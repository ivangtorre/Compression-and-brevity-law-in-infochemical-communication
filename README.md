This database is the curated information obtained from Pherobase dataset: https://www.pherobase.com/

Columns are separated by a comma and the following information is provided:
formula: Indicates the infochemical formula
Cs: Indicates the number of Carbons present in the infochemicals
CAS: Indicates a unique numerical identifier assigned by the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS)
MW: Mollecular Weight
feromonas: This is a list that indicates how the infochemical is used. Each item in a list is how a specie uses this chemical 
especies: This is a list that indicates the specie that uses the infochemical. Length is same as the feremones 
totaluses: Total different uses of the infochemical (by number of species and the ways that a specie uses it) 
P: Total uses of infochemical as Pheromones.
A: Total uses of infochemical as Atractant.
Al: Total uses of infochemical as Allomone.
K: Total uses of infochemical as Keiromone
Sy: Total uses of infochemical as Synomone.
Alelo: Total uses of infochemical as Alelochemical.
